Title
Horiseon Business Website


Description

This is a website designed to inform and bring customers in on the greatness of the Horiseon Business. It is mean't to be pleasant on both the eyes and the brain. Links at the top of the page bring you to the information you are currently most interested in obtaining. It is styled with blue as this colour is the most commonly loved colour for the entire human race meaning that this palette will appeal to the largest group possible. 


One happy accident that has occured with this website is the visual change of the UL at the top of the page. 


I want to thank Rudi for helping me learn github so late into the night, thanks rudi.
